# Air Quality Analysis (EPA 2025 Data)

## Overview
This project analyzes county-level Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to examine regional variation and pollutant contributions.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions
- How does air quality vary by state?
- What pollutants are associated with higher AQI levels?

## Key Findings
- Significant variation in average AQI across states.
- Higher PM2.5 days were associated with elevated AQI levels.
- Data cleaning was required to remove non-U.S. regions for consistent analysis.

## Files
- `aqi_analysis.ipynb` → Full notebook analysis
- `annual_aqi_by_county_2025.csv` → Dataset (if allowed to share)

## Future Improvements
- Add interactive dashboard
- Include geographic mapping
